# Shop-Anime-Merch-Aplication
The application is structured in the form of an anime merch store.
Within the project, 2 roles are allowed: user and admin. Within the user, he can add and/or delete items in/from the shopping cart. 
Before completing the order, he is shown the total amount and is asked to enter the delivery address. Before completing the order, the entered data will be displayed.
Regarding the admin role, he can add and/or delete objects that will represent the stock in the store. For each object, it can decrement and/or decrement the stock.

The store's stock is represented by the following elements: objects (they have no specific characteristics), manga (each manga category presents a volume vector) 
and clothing elements (the specific characteristics are size and color and gender).

Both the user and the admin can change their account details after authentication. 
The application is made in C++ using OOP concepts (inheritance) and at the same time it does not present a graphical interface. A file system was used to store the data within the application
